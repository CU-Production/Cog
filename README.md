## Setup

### Testing the sample

You must have Unreal 5.1 or greater and Visual Studio to launch the sample

1. Download the code
2. Right Click `Cog.uproject` and click `Generate Visual Studio project files`
3. Open Cog.sln
4. Select the `DebugGame Editor` or `Development Editor` solution configuration
5. Make sure `Cog` is set as the startup project
6. Start Debugging (F5)
7. Once in Unreal, press Play (Alt+P)
8. Press the `[Insert]` key or use the `Cog.ToggleInput` console command to open the Imgui Main Menu.

### Integrating Cog in your project

The Cog repository has the following structure:
- `CogSample` - A Sample that demonstrate various Cog functionalities. The project was saved in Unreal 5.1
- `Plugins/CogAbility` - ImGui windows for the Gameplay Ability System (Abilities, Effects, Tags, ...)
- `Plugins/CogInput` - ImGui windows for the Enhanced Input library (Input action, Gamepad)
- `Plugins/CogEngine` - ImGui windows for the core unreal engine functionalities (Log, Stats, Time, Collisions, Skeleton, ...)
- `Plugins/CogWindow` - ImGui window management (Base Window, Layout)
- `Plugins/CogDebug` - Debug functionalities (Log, Debug Draw, Plot, Metric, ...)
- `Plugins/CogImGui` - Integration of Imgui for Unreal, inspired by [UnrealImGui](https://github.com/segross/UnrealImGui)
- `Plugins/CogCommon` - Common headers

Cog has multiple plugins to ease the integration for projects that do not use the `Ability System Component` or `Enhanced Input`. For the next steps, it is assumed all the plugins are used.

1. Setup up module dependencies:

```c#
// CogSample.Build.cs
using UnrealBuildTool;

public class CogSample : ModuleRules
{
    public CogSample(ReadOnlyTargetRules Target) : base(Target)
    {
        PCHUsage = PCHUsageMode.UseExplicitOrSharedPCHs;
        PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] 
        { 
            "CogCommon",  // The CogCommon is required on all target configuration
            "Core",
            "CoreUObject", 
            "Engine", 
            "EnhancedInput",
            "GameplayTasks",
            "GameplayAbilities",
            "GameplayTags",
            "InputCore", 
            "NetCore",
        });

        // Other Cog plugins can be added only for specific target configuration
        if (Target.Configuration != UnrealTargetConfiguration.Shipping)
        {
            PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[]
            {
                "CogDebug",
                "CogImgui",
                "CogWindow",
                "CogEngine",
                "CogInput",
                "CogAbility",
            });
        }
    }
}
```

2. In the class of your choice (in the sample we use the GameState class) add a reference to the CogWindowManager:

```cpp
// ACogSampleGameState.h
#pragma once

#include "CoreMinimal.h"
#include "CogCommon.h"
#include "GameFramework/GameStateBase.h"
#include "CogSampleGameState.generated.h"

class UCogWindowManager;

UCLASS()
class ACogSampleGameState : public AGameStateBase
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

    [...]

    // To make sure it doesn't get garbage collected.
    UPROPERTY()
    TObjectPtr<UObject> CogWindowManagerRef = nullptr;

#if ENABLE_COG
    TObjectPtr<UCogWindowManager> CogWindowManager = nullptr;
#endif //ENABLE_COG
};
```
3. Instantiate the CogWindowManager and add some windows:

```cpp
// ACogSampleGameState.cpp
void ACogSampleGameState::BeginPlay()
{
    Super::BeginPlay();

#if ENABLE_COG
    CogWindowManager = NewObject<UCogWindowManager>(this);
    CogWindowManagerRef = CogWindowManager;

    // Add windows
    CogWindowManager->CreateWindow<UCogEngineWindow_DebugSettings>("Engine.Debug Settings");
    CogWindowManager->CreateWindow<UCogEngineWindow_ImGui>("Engine.ImGui");

    // Add windows that uses a data asset. The data asset must be created inside Unreal Editor.
    const UCogAbilityDataAsset* AbilitiesAsset = GetFirstAssetByClass<UCogAbilityDataAsset>();

    UCogAbilityWindow_Abilities* AbilitiesWindow = CogWindowManager->CreateWindow<UCogAbilityWindow_Abilities>("Gameplay.Abilities");
    AbilitiesWindow->Asset = AbilitiesAsset;

    UCogAbilityWindow_Attributes* AttributesWindow = CogWindowManager->CreateWindow<UCogAbilityWindow_Attributes>("Gameplay.Attributes");
    AttributesWindow->Asset = AbilitiesAsset;

    [...]
#endif //ENABLE_COG
}

```

3. Define which key will toggle the input from the game to Imgui:

```cpp
// ACogSampleGameState.cpp
FCogImguiModule::Get().SetToggleInputKey(FCogImGuiKeyInfo(EKeys::Insert));
```

4. Tick the CogWindowManager:

```cpp
// ACogSampleGameState.cpp
void ACogSampleGameState::Tick(float DeltaSeconds)
{
    Super::Tick(DeltaSeconds);

#if ENABLE_COG
    CogWindowManager->Tick(DeltaSeconds);
#endif //ENABLE_COG
}
```

6. Implement Cog Interfaces of the desired actor classes:

```cpp
// CogSampleCharacter.h
UCLASS(config=Game)
class ACogSampleCharacter : public ACharacter
    , public IAbilitySystemInterface
    , public ICogCommonDebugFilteredActorInterface
    , public ICogCommonAllegianceActorInterface
    , public ICogSampleTeamInterface
    , public ICogSampleTargetableInterface
```

```cpp
// CogSamplePlayerController.h
UCLASS(config=Game)
class ACogSamplePlayerController 
    : public APlayerController
    , public ICogCommonPossessorInterface
```

7. In Unreal Editor create and configure the Data Assets
